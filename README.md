### Nice to meeet you ðŸ‘‹

I have one year of web development experience. I've always been
drawn to the idea of programming. When I sat down and tried a
small online class for Python, I was instantly hooked. Ever since,
I've been self-studying daily and joined the University of New
Hampshire Full Stack Program to become competitive in the market.
If you're looking for someone who is intelligent and moldable,
perhaps we will be a good fit.

You can find my resume and my skillset in my portfolio project below. ðŸ˜„
